# Packer Support - Release Notes

Most of the Packer support for Cmder is shamelessly being borrowed from the following repositories.

- [StefanScherer/packer-windows](https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows)
- [Baune8D/packer-windows-desktop](https://github.com/Baune8D/packer-windows-desktop)

Thank you both for the good work!
